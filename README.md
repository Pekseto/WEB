# Rent a car



## Short intro

This project was made by me and my colleague from faculty. I had trouble importing it from GitLab, so I made this repository and added it manually.

## About

We made a small rent a car service where people can browse cars from different shops, add them to their cart and rent them. When you rent a car you get points added to your account and when you reach higher ranks you get discounts. The exact specification for the project can be found in the file "WP_E2_Projekat 2023.pdf".
